NOTES:
Section 1: Introduction

- There are no files included to this course, everything will be written by hand

Section 2: Big O Notation
* OBJECTIVES:
- motiave the need for something like Big O Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity or different algorithms using Big O Notation
- Describe what a logarithm is
